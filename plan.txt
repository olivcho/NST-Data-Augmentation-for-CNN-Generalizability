Train 2 models
1) object detector with no adversarial training data
2) object detector with adversarial training data

Adversarial training data pipeline
- Apply style transfer to source_images using style_images

Execution
- Try non-adversarial object detector on non-adversarial and adversarial data
- Try adversarial object detector on non-adversarial and adversarial data

Analysis
- Compare accuracy, precision, recall from all four groups

Expected results
- Non-adversarial object detector will perform well on non-adversarial data and significantly drop off for adversarial data
- Adversarial object detector will perform better on non-adversarial data than adversarial data
